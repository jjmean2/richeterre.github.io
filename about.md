Hello there!

I'm __Martin Richter__, also known as __richeterre__ /ʁiʃ.tɛʁ/ on the interwebs.

(In case you're wondering, that's an approximation of how a French person would say my last name. Incidentally, it also means "rich earth" in French :blush:)

Despite all this, I'm not French at all, but German with a Finnish twist. A self-diagnosed wikiholic, I love languages, travel often and have opinions on just about everything except coffee. Since 2011, my hometown is Berlin, where I create digital services at [Futurice][futurice-twitter], one of the best workplaces in the world. Come [visit us][futurice-address] to find out why!
