Hello there!

I'm __Martin Richter__, also known as __richeterre__ on the interwebs.

(In case you're wondering â€“ that's an approximation of how a French person would say my last name. Incidentally, it also means "rich earth" in French :blush:)

Despite all this, I'm not French at all, but German with a Finnish twist. Since 2011, my hometown is Berlin, where I craft digital services at [Futurice][futurice], one of the best workplaces in the world. Come visit us to find out why!

Oh, and this site was built using the wonderful [Jekyll][jekyll].
